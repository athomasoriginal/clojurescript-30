# 17 Sort Without Articles

This lesson goes over things like regexes and comparators

- [Sorting](#sort)
- [Strip](#strip)
- [Regex](#regex)

# Requirements

Please ensure you have a clojure environment running locally - see [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/tkjone/clojurescript-30#getting-started) if you need to set one up.

# Quickstart

Run the following comamnds from the root of the `18-mousemove-and-text-shadows`

**1. Run the projcet**

```bash
clj -M:dev
```

> `-M` assumes your using a Clojure Tools version greater than `1.10.3.855`.  Not sure what version your on?  Run `clj -h` and you should see output near the top of the output like:

```bash
âžœ clj -h
Version: 1.10.3.855 # this is the version your on
```


**2. Visit the app**

# Sorting

Sorting is not difficult in JS or Clojure, but clojure definitely provides a more terse syntax.

```clojure
(def bands ["The Plot in You", "The Devil Wears Prada", "Pierce the Veil"])

(sort bands)
```

The above will alphabetically sort things for you. In JS you would have to pass a [comparator](https://clojure.org/guides/comparators) (a function that tells sort how to sort things). Having said this, the task we are trying to execute does require we pass `sort` a `comparator` even in clojure.

# Regex

Regex always feels oddly different when I write them in clojure, so I wanted to note how to write case-insensitive regexes here:

```clojure
 #"(?i)a |the |an "
```

As you can see, you prefix with `(?i)`. Most everything else about regexes is usually the same, but you get odd moments like the above where your just left wondering.

# Strip

This can also be known as `trimming`, but the idea is the same: Remove a type or series of characters from a string. The most common case is usually `trimming` whitespace. This is likely why clojure actually provides a `trim` function.
